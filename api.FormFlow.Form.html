						<p>Form declarations are contained in an array in the <a href="../#formlists">FormFlow.formLists</a> map. The first Form in the 'main' formList is in bold below:
						<pre>{
  docBase: &quot;/root&quot;,
  formLists: {
    main: [
      <strong>{
        id: &quot;name&quot;,
        url: &quot;/forms/example/name-form.html&quot;,
        actions: [ &quot;next&quot; ]
      }</strong>,
      {
        id: "address",
        url: "/forms/example/address-form.html",
        actions: [ "back", "finish" ]
      }
    ]
  }
}</pre>
						</p>
						<p>Here the Form object has just the three required properties; id, url and actions.</p>
					
						<h2>Required Form Properties</h2>
					
						<p><span class="lingo">id</span> - a name which identifies the form, must be is unique in the current list.</p>
						<p><span class="lingo">url</span> - the path to the form file on disk, relative to the root of the webapp.</p>
						<p><span class="lingo">actions</span> - an array of Actions this form can perform. There are a few simple action strings; "next", "back" and "cancel", but they can be more complex. More on actions here: <a href="action/">FormFlow > Action</a>.</p>
						
						
						<h2>Optional Form Properties</h2>
						
						<p><span class="lingo">docBase</span> - a form-level docBase which overrides the flow docBase while this form or it's subforms are in use.</p>
						
					</div>
