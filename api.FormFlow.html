						<p>The FormFlow is the declaration of a set of forms and their allowed behaviour.</p>
						<p>The FormFlow is defined as a JavaScript file containing a single object declaration. Here is a simple flow with just two forms:
						<pre>{
  <strong>docBase</strong>: &quot;/root&quot;,
  <strong>formLists</strong>: {
    main: [
      {
        id: &quot;name&quot;,
        url: &quot;/forms/example/name-form.html&quot;,
        actions: [ &quot;next&quot; ]
      },
      {
        id: &quot;address&quot;,
        url: &quot;/forms/example/address-form.html&quot;,
        actions: [ &quot;back&quot;, &quot;finish&quot; ]
      }
    ]
  }
}</pre>
					</p>
					<p>In bold are the two required properties; docBase and formLists.</p>
					
					<h2>Required FormFlow Properties</h2>
					
					<p><span class="lingo">docBase</span> - the base path in the DataDocument which the flow will act on. </p>
					<p><a id="formlists" class="anchor"></a><span class="lingo">formLists</span> - a map of key/<a href="form/">Form</a> array pairs. There must be a key named 'main', this is the entry point when a flow is loaded. Other form lists are accessed using form <a href="form/action/">Actions</a>.
					<!--<br/>Sometimes more than one form list is needed in the flow, for example if you were collecting information about a DVD boxset; the main list could be used to collect general information about the pack and a second list of forms could be used to collect information about each DVD in the set.--></p>
					
					<h2>Optional FormFlow Properties</h2>
					
					<pre>{
  docBase: &quot;/myRootElement&quot;,
  <strong>defaultInitalData</strong>: "the-initial-data.xml",
  <strong>libraries</strong>: ["js/my-util-methods.js"],
  formLists: { ... }
}</pre>
					
					<p><span class="lingo">defaultInitalData</span> - the name of an XML file in your flow directory which will be used to create the <a>DataDocument</a> for each new session.</p>
					
					<p><span class="lingo">libraries</span> - an array of relative paths to JavaScript libraries you would like to be loaded on the server for use in <a>validationFunctions</a>. </p>
