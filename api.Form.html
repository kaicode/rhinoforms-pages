						<p>Rhinoforms Forms are written in good old HTML.</p>
						<p>One of the main principles of Rhinoforms is that forms code should be readable. Anyone with basic HTML knowledge should be able to read and understand the code, not take one look and run half a mile in the other direction (like XForms, cough!)</p>
						<p>A simple form might look like this:</p>
						<pre>&lt;form rhinoforms=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;firstName&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; rf.validation=&quot;required&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;email&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; rf.validation=&quot;required email&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; action=&quot;next&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
						<p>A Rhinoforms Form must be marked with the attribute <strong>rhinoforms='true'</strong>, this tells the parser to process the form.</p>
						
						<p>There should be no <strong>action</strong> or <strong>method</strong> attributes on the &lt;form&gt; tag. This is because all forms are posted to the Rhinoforms Servlet for server-side validation. The action url does not make it's way into the browser, this way no one can bypass the forms. The collected data can make it's way to a web endpoint using a <a href="/api/FormFlow/Form/Action/Submission/">submission</a>, or the Rhinoforms Servlet may just respond with the next form. All that logic is tucked away in the <a href="/api/FormFlow">FormFlow</a>.</p>
						
						<p>The &lt;input&gt; fields have some custom attributes on them:</p>
						<pre>&lt;input name=&quot;firstName&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; <strong>rf.validation=&quot;required&quot;</strong> /&gt;
&lt;input name=&quot;email&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; <strong>rf.validation=&quot;required email&quot;</strong> /&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; <strong>action=&quot;next&quot;</strong> /&gt;</pre>
